# ruFAST
Rust bindings for FAST

RuFAST is a set of Rust bindings for libFAST https://github.com/smistad/FAST
 (Framework for Heterogeneous Medical Image Computing and Visualization)

Currently it only provides raw access to C wrappers without providing any
object lifetime guarantees. However, providing more idiomatic interfaces is planned.
